# Vendease Code Exercise

Write an app that:

- Read/parse people information represented in different formats

  Find a sample of each format in `fixtures`

- Combine the entries from the different formats

- Sort the entries by `first_name`

- Format each entry to `<first_name>, <city>, <birth_date M/D/YYYY>`

- When you run app.js, make sure logs the following array
   ```
     [
        'Elliot, New York City, 5/4/1947',
        'Mckayla, Atlanta, 5/29/1986',
        'Rhiannon, Los Angeles, 4/30/1974',
        'Rigoberto, New York City, 1/5/1962',
      ]
    ```

- Write at least 3 specs, but no more than 10 - we don't expect 100% coverage

### Notes
- Don't change files under `fixtures`
- Don't use any npm package to accomplish the solution
- Don't worry about invalid input data (if your solution works for the sample data, that's what we need)

## What we expect to see in your solution

- Cleanliness/Clarity: Is the intent of the code obvious? Are things named appropriately? Please void overly clever solutions.
- Consistent style: We don't expect you to follow a specific Nodejs code style, but you should be consistent with your choice.
- Maintainability: How flexible is the code?
- Testability: Is it easy to test the code? Please demonstrate with unit tests.
- Use DRY, KISS and SOLID responsibly to find the sweet spot between an under-engineering and over-engineering.

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository

3. Create a branch to work on the solution

4. Write code and unit tests

5. Push your branch and create a pull request on GitHub
